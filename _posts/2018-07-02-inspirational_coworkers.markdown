For the past year and a half I've been working for a cool tech company based in NYC. I came in as employee number 16 and as of today we are now at 50+ employees. Having come in when the company was super small allowed me to build close relationships with my co-workers -- most of them happened to be software engineers, analytical folkd and data devotees. I was always fascinated by the work they were doing and found myself randomly hovering over their shoulders and constantly asking them questions. This was almost a daily occurance that ultimately led me to joining them for hackathons where they'd work on personal projects and code while I got my hands dirty in some good old Code Academy lessons. After several months one of my co-workers suggested I try taking my education to the next level  and here I am taking babysteps to becoming a fullstack developer!
